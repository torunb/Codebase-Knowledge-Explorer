"### Explanation of `calculateArithmeticMean`

The `calculateArithmeticMean` function computes the arithmetic mean (average) of an integer array (`numbers`). Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization of Sum**: It initializes an integer variable `sum` to 0.
2. **Iterative Summation**: It iterates through each number in the array `numbers` and calculates the cumulative sum by using the `MathLibrary.sum` method.
3. **(Missing Logic)** The function appears incomplete, as it does not divide the total sum by the number of elements to calculate the mean or return any value. 

**Purpose**: Its intended functionality is to calculate the arithmetic mean of an array of integers, but it is incomplete (missing division and return logic).

### Contextual Notes:
- **Caller Functions**: Several functions rely on `calculateArithmeticMean` (e.g., for calculating product of means, standard deviation, variance), indicating its importance for statistical computations.
- **Callee Functions**: The function uses `MathLibrary.sum`, a utility for basic addition.",0.85
"The provided `calculateArithmeticMeanOfFactorialSums` function computes the arithmetic mean of the factorial sums of numbers from 1 to `n`. It iteratively calculates the factorial sum for each number `i` (using the `calculateFactorialSum` function from `File2`), accumulates these sums into `sumOfFactorialSums`, and presumably aims to calculate the mean once the loop is complete (though the actual mean calculation is missing in the code provided). 

The functionality depends heavily on the helper methods `calculateFactorialSum`, `sum`, and possibly `divide` (though `divide` is unused here).",0.97
"The `calculateArithmeticMeanOfSquares` function computes the arithmetic mean of the squares of the integers in the input array `numbers`. It iterates through the array, calculates the square of each integer using `MathLibrary.power`, and sums these squares using `MathLibrary.sum`. However, the function is incomplete as it lacks the necessary final step of dividing the total `sumOfSquares` by the number of elements in the array to compute the arithmetic mean.",0.94
"The `calculateArithmeticSeries` function calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series given the first term (`a`), common difference (`d`), and the number of terms (`n`). Using helper functions from `MathLibrary` for basic arithmetic operations, it computes the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:  

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a + (n-1)d)
\]  

This is achieved by:
1. Calculating \( 2a \) (first term multiplied by 2).
2. Computing \( (n-1)d \) (common difference contribution).
3. Summing \( 2a \) and \( (n-1)d \).
4. Multiplying by \( n \).
5. Dividing the result by 2 to finalize the series sum.

The function ensures modularity by offloading basic arithmetic operations to reusable methods.",0.97
"The `calculateBinomialCoefficient` function computes the binomial coefficient (n choose k) by delegating the calculation to the `MathLibrary.combination` method. It ensures that the logic for computing combinations is centralized in the `combination` method, which also handles input validation for `n` and `k`. This function is used in contexts such as summing binomial coefficients.",0.84

"The `calculateSumOfFactorials` function calculates the sum of the factorials of all integers from 1 to `n`. It does this by iterating from 1 to `n`, computing the factorial of each integer using the `MathLibrary.factorial` method, and then adding the result to a cumulative `sum` using the `MathLibrary.sum` method. Note that the intermediate results of `sum` and `factorial` are cast to integers during the addition.",0.93
"The `calculateSumOfFibonacciNumbers` function computes the sum of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. It iterates from 0 to `n`, calculates each Fibonacci number using the `File1.calculateFibonacci` function, and adds it to a cumulative `sum` using `MathLibrary.sum`. This implementation uses integer casting but may encounter precision issues for larger values due to type constraints (`int` casting and arithmetic).",0.94

"The `calculateSumOfGeometricSeries` function computes the cumulative sum of partial sums for a geometric series. It iterates `n` times, where each iteration calculates the `i-th` partial sum of the series using `File1.calculateGeometricSeries(a, r, i)` and accumulates the result into `sum` using the `MathLibrary.sum` function. The calculations use integer casting, which may lose precision for non-integer values. 

### Observations:
- **Purpose:** To calculate the sum of progressively growing geometric series terms up to the `n-th` term.
- **Dependencies:** Relies on `MathLibrary` for arithmetic operations and `File1.calculateGeometricSeries` for individual term computation.
- **Flaws:** Possible precision issues due to repeated integer casting during calculations.",0.95
"The `calculateSumOfHarmonicMeans` function computes the harmonic means of two arrays of doubles (`numbers1` and `numbers2`) using the `File2.calculateHarmonicMean` method. It then converts these harmonic means to integers and sums them using the `MathLibrary.sum` method, returning the result as an integer. The function primarily aims to calculate and combine approximate (integer) harmonic mean values of two datasets.",0.89
"The `calculateSumOfPrimes(int n)` function computes the sum of all prime numbers from 2 to `n`. It uses the helper function `isPrime(int number)` to check if a number is prime and adds it to a running total using `MathLibrary.sum(int a, int b)`. The result is stored in `sum`.",0.93
"The function `calculateSumOfSineWaves` computes the cumulative sum of sine wave values for a given amplitude, frequency, and integer iterations `n`. It calls `calculateSineWave` (via `File1`) to calculate the sine wave value at each iteration, converts it and the running total (`sum`) to integers, and aggregates these values using `MathLibrary.sum`. The function lacks precision due to frequent type-casting to integers, which truncates the original floating-point values, potentially reducing accuracy.",0.85

"The `calculateTangentWave` function computes the tangent wave value for a given amplitude, frequency, and time. It first calculates the product of frequency and time, then derives an angle by multiplying this result with \( 2\pi \). Using this angle, it calculates the tangent via `Math.tan`, then scales the result by multiplying with the amplitude. Notably, all operations cast inputs to integers, which may lead to precision loss.",0.93
"The `calculateTriangularNumber` function computes the nth triangular number, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. It does so using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. It utilizes helper methods from `MathLibrary` to perform addition (`sum`), multiplication (`multiply`), and division (`divide`) to achieve this calculation.",0.87
"The `calculateTriangularNumberOfFactorials` function computes the ""triangular number"" of the factorial of a given integer `n`. Specifically:

1. It calculates the factorial of `n` using `MathLibrary.factorial(n)`.
2. It computes `n + 1` using `MathLibrary.sum(n, 1)`.
3. It multiplies these two values (`factorial(n)` and `n + 1`) using `MathLibrary.multiply`.
4. It divides the product by `2` using `MathLibrary.divide`.

This produces the sum of the first `n + 1` factorial numbers, following the triangular number formula \((n \cdot (n + 1)) / 2\), but applied to the factorial value.",0.91
"The `calculateVariance` function computes the variance of an array of integers (`numbers`). It first calculates the arithmetic mean of the array using the helper function `calculateArithmeticMean`. It then iterates through the array, computes the squared deviation of each number from the mean (`(number - mean)^2`), and accumulates these squared deviations in a `sum` variable using the `MathLibrary.power` and `MathLibrary.sum` methods. The implementation lacks the final division step to compute the actual variance, so it only calculates the sum of squared deviations (`sum`), not the variance itself.

### Observations:
- The final variance computation requires dividing `sum` by the size of the array, which is missing from this implementation.
- Error-prone casts from `double` to `int` during computation may lead to precision loss.",0.92
"The `calculateVarianceOfFactorials` function computes the factorials of numbers from 1 to `n` (stored in the `factorials` array) using the `MathLibrary.factorial` method. However, the code snippet is incomplete and does not show how the variance is calculated or returned, suggesting that it may be incomplete or missing sections.",0.94
"The `calculateWeightedHarmonicMean` function calculates the weighted harmonic mean of an array of values, using a corresponding array of weights. It first checks if the lengths of the `values` and `weights` arrays match to ensure valid input. If not, it throws an exception. Based on the provided callee functions, the operations like division, multiplication, and summation could be used to compute the final result.",0.93

"The `calculateWeightedMeanOfFactorialSums` function computes the weighted mean of the factorial sums of the elements in the `values` array, using the associated `weights` array. It enforces that both arrays must have the same length. The primary calculations involve:

1. **Factorial Sum Calculation:** For each element `n` in the `values` array, the `calculateFactorialSum(int n)` function computes the sum of factorials of integers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Weight Application:** Each factorial sum is multiplied by the corresponding weight in the `weights` array.
3. **Weighted Sum and Mean:** The weighted sum of the factorial sums is then divided by the total sum of weights using `divide(int a, int b)` to compute the weighted mean.

The function ensures input validity (matching lengths of `values` and `weights`) and relies on helper functions for mathematical operations (factorial, multiplication, summation, and division).",0.78
"The `calculateWeightedMeanOfSquares` function ensures that the `values` and `weights` arrays have the same length, throwing an exception otherwise. While the full implementation is not provided, the function likely calculates a weighted mean of the squared values using helper functions, such as `multiply` (likely for computing weights with squared values), `power` (for squaring each value), `sum` (for aggregating results), and possibly `divide` (for normalization). Its purpose is likely to compute a value representing the weighted mean of squared elements, factoring in provided weights.",0.84
"The `isPrime` function determines whether a given integer `number` is a prime number. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1 (not prime) and iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number (`Math.sqrt(number)`). For each `i` in the loop, it calculates the remainder of `number` divided by `i` using the `calculateModulo` function. If the remainder is 0, it concludes the number is not prime and returns `false`; otherwise, it continues the iteration. If no divisor is found, it implicitly returns `true`, indicating the number is prime.

**Purpose**: This function is used in caller methods like `calculatePrimeFactorialSum` and `calculateSumOfPrimes` to filter prime numbers for further computations, such as summing or calculating factorials.",0.96
"The `calculateTriangularNumber` function calculates the *n*-th triangular number, which is the sum of the first *n* natural numbers. It uses helper functions from `MathLibrary` to compute the result. The process involves summing *n* and 1 (`sum`), multiplying the result by *n* (`multiply`), and dividing the product by 2 (`divide`) to obtain the triangular number.",0.85
