First, the method calculates r raised to the power of n using the power method from MathLibrary, which internally uses Math.pow to compute the result. This value is stored in the variable rPowerN.

The second method, combination, is also a public static method and is responsible for the actual computation of the binomial coefficient. It takes two integer parameters, n and r (where r is analogous to k in the first method). The method first checks if the provided values for n and r are valid. Specifically, it ensures that r is not greater than n, and that neither n nor r are negative. If any of these conditions are violated, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with an appropriate error message.

If the input values are valid, the method proceeds to calculate the binomial coefficient using the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!).

The multiply method returns the product of two integers, the sum method returns the sum of two integers, and the divide method returns the quotient of two integers as a double, with a check to prevent division by zero.

Additionally, the IllegalArgumentException class extends RuntimeException and provides multiple constructors for creating exceptions with different levels of detail, such as a message, a cause, or both.

The RMS is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity and is particularly useful in various fields such as physics and engineering.

The calculateRootMeanSquare method begins by initializing a variable sumOfSquares to zero. It then iterates over each integer in the input array numbers. For each integer num, it calculates the square of the number using the MathLibrary.power method, which internally uses Math.pow to perform the exponentiation. The squared value is then added to sumOfSquares using the MathLibrary.sum method, which simply adds two integers.

The helper methods used in calculateRootMeanSquare are defined as follows:

power(double base, int exponent): Uses Math.pow to raise the base to the power of the exponent.

First, the method calls MathLibrary.divide(a, b) to perform the division of a by b. The divide method checks if b is zero to prevent division by zero, which would throw an IllegalArgumentException. If b is not zero, it returns the result of the division as a double.

Next, the calculateModulo method casts the result of the division to an int, effectively truncating any decimal portion, and then calls MathLibrary.multiply((int)quotient, b). The multiply method simply returns the product of the two integers. This step essentially reconstructs the largest multiple of b that is less than or equal to a.

The calculateMedian method first sorts the input array numbers using the java.util.Arrays.sort method. Sorting is essential because the median calculation requires the numbers to be in ascending order. After sorting, the method calculates the middle index of the array.

The method then proceeds to check for factors of the number by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number. This is an optimization because if a number n is divisible by some number p, then n is also divisible by n/p, and one of these factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of the division of the number by the current iterator i using the calculateModulo method. If the remainder is zero, it means i is a divisor of the number, and the method returns false, indicating that the number is not prime.

The method uses a loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to n, storing the result in a variable result, which is returned at the end.

The sum method is straightforward, taking two integers a and b and returning their sum. The divide method takes two integers a and b, checks if b is zero to avoid division by zero, and returns the result of the division as a double.

The sqrt method is annotated with @HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate, indicating that it is a candidate for intrinsic optimization by the JVM. It delegates the square root calculation to StrictMath.sqrt, which ensures consistent results across different platforms. The method benefits from potential hardware optimizations, making it faster than a software-based implementation.","public static double calculateRootMeanSquareOfFactorials(int n) {

It then iterates from 2 to n, updating a and b to the next Fibonacci number in the sequence by summing the previous two numbers using the sum function from MathLibrary.

The method initializes a variable sum to 0.0 to accumulate the total distance. It then iterates from 1 to n, and in each iteration, it calculates the distance between the point (x1, y1) and the point (i, i) using the calculateDistanceBetweenPoints method from File1. The calculated distance is then added to the sum using the MathLibrary.sum method, which casts the double values to integers before summing them. Finally, the method returns the total sum of distances.

The calculateDistanceBetweenPoints method computes the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It first calculates the differences in the x and y coordinates using the MathLibrary.subtract method. These differences are then squared using the MathLibrary.power method. The squared differences are summed using the MathLibrary.sum method, and the square root of this sum is taken to get the distance between the two points.

The method begins by calculating the factorial of n using a method from the MathLibrary class. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n. This result is stored in the variable factorial.

Next, the method calculates n + 1 using another method from the MathLibrary class, storing the result in the variable nPlus1. This step is necessary for the subsequent multiplication operation.

The method then multiplies the factorial of n by n + 1, again using a method from the MathLibrary class. The result of this multiplication is stored in the variable product.

Finally, the method divides the product by 2 to compute the final result, which is returned as a double. This division is performed using the MathLibrary.divide method. The overall calculation can be interpreted as finding the triangular number of the factorial of n, adjusted by the factor of n + 1 and then halved.

In summary, the method leverages several utility functions from the MathLibrary class to perform a series of arithmetic operations, ultimately returning a double value that represents a specific mathematical computation involving factorials and triangular numbers.","public static double calculateTriangularNumberOfFactorials(int n) {
